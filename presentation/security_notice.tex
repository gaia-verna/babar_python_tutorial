		{\color{red}DO NOT} use IPython notebook on shared computers (yakut noric etc.). The default setting is very unsecure.
	\end{block}
	\begin{block}{Long Version}
		{\color{red}DO NOT} use IPython notebook on shared computers unless you know what you are doing.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The default setting only listen on localhost with no password. This is OK on your personal computer. But, on shared computer everyone is on localhost.
			\item IPython executes code as you. So, anyone with access to localhost will be able
			      to execute code as you. This means they can delete your files and edit your codes and a bunch of other things.
			\item It is possible to setup password and have it binds to non-localhost/specific port etc. But, I won't go into details but the keyword is \emph{IPython profile}.
